# Millet Sourcer - An aggregator solution to source millets and millets based foods from local farmers.  

_The year 2023 was recently declared [The International year of Millets](https://www.thehindu.com/business/watch-business-matters-why-did-un-declare-2023-as-international-year-of-millets/article66366169.ece) by the UN as an attempt to solve the global food crisis. Millets had been a staple food source in India since ancient times. Apart from common millets like finger millet(ragi), pearl millet(bajra) and sorghum(jowar), local farmers and tribes produced special millets that were easy to produce and also had high nutritional content. This app is an aggregator that provides a single platform to bridge the demand-supply gap of millets and millets based foods._
